## Hi there 👋

🙋‍♀️ We're [datapad](https://datapad.io) and we're building an app which consolidates all your KPIs to access everything in a zap. It's so easy, even grandmas can use it!

👩‍💻 We mostly use GitHub privately for the moment. Still, we're eager to share things might be useful publicly. So stay tuned and follow us here.

🧙 By the way, you might consider taking a look at our open positions at [datapad.io/job](https://www.datapad.io/jobs) if you have any interest on working in a startup environment.

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
